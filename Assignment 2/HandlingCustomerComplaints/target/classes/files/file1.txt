Thanks for your complaint.

I'd firstly like to offer my sincerest apologies here for this huge inconvenience about the Management. Normally, when an RRSP withdrawal is cancelled, it needs to be reinitiated right away to ensure the funds that were raised are not reinvested automatically the next business day. Upon noticing that the withdrawal was not reinitiated, and at the risk of the funds being invested again, I had taken the liberty of reinitiating it myself with the HBP form provided. However, as you noted and confirmed, it looks like I had opted in for the wrong/default banking which cascaded to your precarious situation.
Though I am glad that you were able to complete the home purchase, I fully understand your concerns. I've raised this to my team here, and I've put forth a request for compensation as a result of my error.
Once more, my sincerest apologies for the additional stress and headache. I'll circle back to you on that end in 2 business days with an update.

Let me know if you have any further questions about this and I'd be happy to help.

<b>Kind Regards
Group 1 </b>
