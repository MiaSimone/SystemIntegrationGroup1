Dear Mr. Malthe!

I would like to invite you to attend our upcoming Liberal Arts department job networking event. The event will be held 
on the afternoon of May 1, 2023. We wish to provide our graduating seniors with an opportunity to meet business leaders 
in the area who may be looking for new hires who hold degrees in the Liberal Arts.

The event will be held at the Cox Student Center at Northern State University and will last about two to three hours. 
If you have an interest in attending or sending a company representative to meet with our students, please let me know 
at your earliest convenience and I can reserve a table for you.

Thank for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.

Respectfully,
Lucy the Cat
