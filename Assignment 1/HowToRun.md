## How To Run

### Dependencies
These dependincies needs to be added manually:
</br>
- [javax.xml.rpc](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67720611/javax-xml-rpc-does-not-exist-maven)
- [org.apache.axis](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.axis/axis/1.4)
- [commons-io](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/commons-io/commons-io/2.11.0)

### Links
- Web services (SOAP): http://wsgeoip.lavasoft.com/ipservice.asmx?wsdl
- REST: https://api.genderize.io/?name=peter&country_id=US

### Need to do
Even though the program looks complete when you have pulled, you need to delete the client folder (Assignment 1/si_assignment1/src/main/java/si/assignments/si_assignment1/client) and add the Web Services under "Add Framework Support" again. The link for this is the SOAP link from above. The output path should be <b>si.assignments.si_assignment1.client</b>.
</br>For some reason IntelliJ doesn't accept the Web Services allready added from GitHub.
